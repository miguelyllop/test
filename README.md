## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/miguelyllop/test/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Prototype A's case study page required user interaction through continued vertical scrolling. I wanted to emulate a timeline effect, so that the user could follow the same progress as a designer would during the logo design process. It also told a more cohesive story and replicates the same informational format that is presented in logo presentation decks.

We wanted to revise this layout by making it more navigation-friendly, as scrolling holds the user back from easily accessing all of the other sections in the case study pages.
                        


 
 In order to improve the current shared channel acceptance flow, I had to understand the dead-ends that users reach when trying to accept an invite. By outlining the process, it was a lot easier to grasp the pain points of the current system in place.
